<h1>About me</h1>

<img src="/assets/images/me.jpg" style="width: 100%" />

<h4>Hi, I'm Jesse!</h4>
<p>
  ...And I love solving problems through great design and simple, elegant
  code. I've got a keen eye for visual and conceptual detail, and I get my
  kicks out of finding wonderfully concise solutions to complex problems.
</p>

<p>
  Being strongly influenced by diversity in software, I spend a lot of my free
  time dabbling with tools and languages I think are neat. While Erlang and
  Haskell have been a couple of my more intriguing forays, I've spent time with
  Clojure, Scala, C, Objective-C, Actionscript, .NET, and Python, among others, and all in
  varying capacities.
</p>

<h4>When I'm not building digital things,</h4>
<p>
  I get my kicks spending time outdoors in the wonderful state of Colorado.
  In recent history I've partaken in plenty of mountain biking,
  hiking, and fly fishing. What occupies most of my time these days, however,
  is challenging my mind and body in life-changing ways through rock climbing.
</p>

<p>
  I do most of my climbing in and around Boulder. You're just as
  likely to see me three pitches up on a long moderate trad line as you are
  to find me pushing the grade in a local climbing gym, but I'm always looking
  for new folks to climb with - hit me up and let's get on the rock!
