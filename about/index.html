  <h1>About me</h1>
  <h4>Hi, I’m Jesse,</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="span7">
      and I write software for a living. I’ve got a keen eye for
      visual and conceptual detail and I’m heavily compelled by the constant struggle
      to find simple, elegant solutions to complex problems.
    </p>

    <p class="span7">
      Being strongly influenced by diversity in software, I spend a lot of my free
      time dabbling with tools and languages I think are neat. While Erlang and
      Clojure have been a couple of my more intriguing forays, I've had hands on
      Haskell, Scala, C, Objective-C, Actionscript, .NET, and Python, among others, and all in
      varying capacities.

  <h4>When I'm not building digital things,</h4>

      I get my kicks spending time outdoors in the wonderful state of Colorado
      (mostly). In recent history I've partaken in plenty of mountain biking,
      hiking, and fly fishing. What occupies most of my time these days, however,
      is challenging my mind and body in life-changing ways through rock climbing.
    </p>

    <p class="span7">
      I spend most of my time on the rock in and around Boulder. You're just as
      likely to see me three pitches up on a long moderate trad line as you are
      to find me pushing the grade in a local climbing gym, but I'm always looking
      for new folks to climb with - hit me up and lets get on the rock!
