# Experience

## Foraker Labs
**10.2013-11.2014**   
**Software Developer**

Working in small, close-knit teams for a handful of clients, I helped Foraker form its agile process around the team and itâ€™s client base to end up with a flavor of Scrum that Foraker can run with. Additionally, I led the initiative in a company-wide mentoring effort for intern and junior developers. Maintaining an extremely high standard for quality-of-work, I incorporated new features to existing, long-lived projects and built new software from the ground up.

Also, as Muse Studio product anchor, I communicated directly with our clients on a regular basis to help guide the direction of the product.
