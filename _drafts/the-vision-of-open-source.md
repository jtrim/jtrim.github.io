Taken at face-value, open-source software is kind of a funny bird, right? Microsoft has made billions [!confirm this] of dollars on keeping their source closed and selling access to the running binary for large sums of money. Writing software and just...giving it away...seems like a crazy proposition to someone outside of the software community, but I'd like to explore the roots of what compels us to do just that.

In our society, money is king. Money makes us spend a third of our days for most of our lives working. If you're with me in being a Daniel Quinn fan, you'll know just how crazy of a proposition this is in the first place, but nevertheless, it's something that exists as the foundation of the world we live in today. That being said, we, as software developers, LOVE to spend hours of our life's energy churning away at code that we just put out there for free. Why is this? Well, I think it's something baked into who we are as humans. It's part of what has gotten us more technological innovation in the last 400 years [!source] than in the other ~2.5 million years of human existence.
