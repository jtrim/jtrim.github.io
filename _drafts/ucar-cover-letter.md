**To Whom It May Concern**,
<br><br>

Hello! My name is Jesse Trimble, and I'm extremely interested in the open Software Engineer/Programmer II position with UCAR. I've been writing software professionally for nearly 8 years, most of which have been medium- to large-sized database-backed web applications. Although I don't have any specific experience in working with scientific data, I'm skilled in designing complex relational databases and am confident I could ramp up quickly on any file formats and import/export methodologies specific to the work the position requires. I'm skilled in writing complex SQL queries, as well as working with higher-level object relational mapping libraries. I've worked under a Unix-like operating system for the past 6 years and am highly proficient within a Unix shell environment. I work extremely well in close-knit teams and am also highly efficient in a more independent, self-driven role.

As you'll see from the resume I've included, all of my experience has been within the realm of commercial web application development. As such, the prospect of working in a more academic, scientific setting, such as the one this position appears to be, is very exciting. Approaching software development from a slightly different perspective - highly data-driven and analysis-based - has been a growing desire of mine for the past several years, and the possibility of working with one of Boulder's scientific leaders is hugely compelling.

I'm looking forward to being in touch to talk about the position in further detail. I'd be a great fit for the position, and I'd love the opportunity to bring my enthusiasm and focus to the UCAR engineering team.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,

Jesse Trimble
