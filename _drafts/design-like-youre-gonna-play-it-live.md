I tend to have a somewhat particular taste in music. I don't think that there
is a *right* or *wrong* way to produce music, but I have a pretty specific
recipe of ingredients that are usually found in music I really dig. One of
those things is the way music sounds when it's recorded as if it were being
played live.

So what does that mean? What's different about music recorded live than music
recorded in a studio?

Lots of music, especially pop and progressive rock, spend a LOT of energy on
production quality. This usually boils down to playing songs in pieces - play
a hard solo after the rhythm section is laid, play complex haromonies apart
from drum / bass, etc. The result is airbrushed music - "perfect" in every way:
tempo, articulation and synchronoziation all have a robotic-sort of
qualitiy.

In addition to production quality, you find musicians achieving things in the
studio that just aren't possible live. For example, if you've got a band made
up of a guitarist, a bassist, and a drummer, and you hear a solo overlaying
rhythm guitars, you can expect one of two things live: there'll be a guest
guitarist present or the song will omit one of the parts altogether.

#### How does this translate to design?

When designing for the web, it's easy to design like you're in a recording
studio. You take some liberites, add some spice to what are usually native
browser controls, and what you end up with is a super-polished, very
attractive design that is expensive and difficult to execute in a live
scenario. I've found that this is the case most of the time when folks who come
from an illustration or print design background, particularly in larger
organizations where design and development are sizeable, separate departments.
Such designs can lead to a few unpleasant scenarios:

- The sci-fi design elements get dropped from the launch version
- The timeline gets bloated to accomodate the additional effort
- The codebase gets crufty to support an overly-imaginative design

As developers, this is an easy thing to spot. But what can we do about it?

#### Pairing: not just for code

For a non-developer that wants (or needs) to understand what design components
are feasible has a pretty steep hill to climb. Developers are notoriously bad
at internalizing things, and UI feasibility is no exception. We take for
granted that our peers know things like custom select boxes are damned
unpleasant to code, for example. But once we understand this internalization,
we're in a position to do something about it.

Before I dive in to this topic, one clarification - I'm not suggesting that
every designer should learn how to code. I feel like thinking in terms of code
alters the creative process for some, so I don't think it's fair to say "Only
good designers code." However, at least in these terms, identifying a design
element that can be a digital red herring is mostly painted black and white. As
such, this know-how is usually pretty quick and easy to pass on.

When two developers pair on a problem, and especially when the two developers
really mesh, it's very much an act of filling in each other's weaknesses and
augmenting the other's strengths. I believe the same thing can happen across
disciplines. The details are mostly outside the scope of this text, but [Anders
Ramsay explores this in detail
here](http://www.andersramsay.com/2009/05/01/less-wireframes-more-collaboration-with-pair-design/).
With cross-discipline pairing, two advantages become clear pretty quickly,

- Design / concept rabbit holes essentially disappear
- Implementation pains becomes very real for the designer

...with a third peripheral benefit:

- TODO
