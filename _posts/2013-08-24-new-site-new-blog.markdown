#### New site!

It's been about a year since jessetrimble.com has seen anything new visually so
I felt like it needed a change. What started out as a couple small tweaks ended
in me ditching my custom [Speakeasy](https://github.com/jtrim/speakeasy) codebase and jumping
onto [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). To summarize my experience thus far:

<pre>
I <3 Jekyll!!!
</pre>

With great documentataion and a super easy deployment mechanism (basically,
push to github => done), Jekyll beats the pants off other solutions I've used
in the past.

#### New blog!

In the past couple of years I've given several shots at blogging in various
capacities, but it always seemed like whatever tool I was using at the time
kinda got in the way / caused me to be distracted while writing. After having
discovered [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) I've found writing much more
enjoyable, so with the help of Jekyll, here I am giving it another shot.
Jekyll publishes blog articles from a markdown source so it's really easy to
start with a plain-text rough draft and move to a polished article relatively
quickly.

I tend to write mostly about code-related topics (or software in general), but
I'll occasionally venture into social topics, among other things. I probably
don't spend as much time proofing my content as I should, but spelling and
grammatical errors aside, I hope the content compels you to dig deeper, learn
things you didn't know, and above all, find more ways to have fun doing what
you do. Stay tuned!
